# Session 1 
## Course welcomes and scavenger hunt.

In the first session we were introduced to Thomas, our gracious leader, our fellow students, along with the course that we are about to embark on this semester.

### A brief introduction

For some extracurricular kudos, I will now answer some non-required questions about myself. You're welcome! 

#### Who am I?

Hi, I'm Curtis.

![A selfie](250303/selfie.jpeg)

I am 26 years old and have been studying *poorly* here at RMIT since the start of 2024.

Outside of work and study, my interests lie in music, film, photography & analogue media.

#### Where have I come from?

While my family is Australian, I was born in the United States while my parents lived there. In the process, I scammed the seppys out of a citizenship and passport. *Please don't tell the IRS where I am.*

In 2004, I moved back to Australia, where I have now lived in Sydney, Canberra, and Melbourne. I claim Canberra as my hometown as that is the city that has currently shaped me most & I lived there the longest. Other than that I have also lived in both the United Kingdom and India, where I somehow managed to complete High School.

I have worked as a bartender since I was 18. *Holy cow, 8 years!*

I have hobby experience in music production, photography and film making, although no professional experience just yet.

#### What is my purpose here?

One of the things that most drew me to Digital Media is its multi-disciplinary aspect. I'm excited to be able to explore several different mediums before chosing one path forward to dive deeper. 

In my previous studies under a bachelor of arts I loved learning about society and the role that technology has and will continue to play on it. That said, I felt limited by only being able to respond to this through the written word. While it is important to understand and theorise the complex problems society faces, design presents a means to respond directly and offer potential solutions that can speak to all, rather than just the educated few.  

Through this degree, I'm keen to develop my interests into workable skills and explore fields unfamilar to me. I hope to develop my voice, and continue to respond to concepts related to society and technology, this time through a multimedia response.

While still unsure which specialisation I plan to pursue, I aspire to develop a varied skillset so I can jump into a small production team and adapt quickly to fill necessary gaps. I am inspired by independant film-makers, especially documentarians, and have always been a sucker for quality sound design. Perhaps I will continue towards film and sound, although environmental design intruiges me and the allure of UX design salaries is certainly desirable.

While unsure if possible through this degree, I have always been fascinated by media archiving and curation, along with digital heritage. I would love to explore how the design process could be applied to other digital mediums beyond typical media formats, such as through code, algorithms and systems without the need for a computer science degree.

## Scavenger Hunt

Well that's certainly enough about me. 

During class, I teamed up with a ragtag group of other students in my cohort to orient ourselves around campus.

The team consisted of my new friends Alan, Alyanna, Benny, Jennifer, Wendy & Zak.

### The List
Here is what we were asked to find:

![Scavenger Hunt List](250303/scavlist.png)

I had an admittedly unfair advantage over other students, so I used the opportunity to guide my fellow teammates and *definitely* suppressed all competitive urges.

#### Explosive Coffee

First off was an explosive cup of coffee, which describes the logo of Bang Coffee on Swanston Street.

![explosive coffee](250303/explosivecoffee.jpg)

#### Book of Wisdom 

Then we had to find a book containing digital media wisdom amungst many. So we trotted off to Swanston Library, and searched the catalog to find Super Connected: The Internet, Digital Media, and Techno-Social Life by Chayko, M.

![book of wisdom](250303/bookofwisdom.jpg)

#### Net above

Before that however, as we entered Swanston Library, we spotted behind a window a net woven from paper hanging above level 4 of Building 10. Wouldn't want to fall that far, I'd say it qualifies.

![net up high](250303/netuphigh.jpg)

#### Curtain of Roots

This entry stumped us. While this find was certainly a stretch, our team made a cunning plan to make a photo op that could, with a degree of leniency, qualify.

![curtain of roots with authentic winged visitor](250303/wingedvisitor.jpg)

#### Door of Condemnation

The definition of the term *condemned* has multiple meanings. One of which held the key to finding this item. To quote Oxford Dictionary:

##### Condemned:

*adjective*

"Sentenced to a particular punishment, especially death."

[^1]Oxford Languages, *Oxford University Press*

With that in mind, we went to explore the Old Melbourne Gaol.

![door for condemned](250303/door4condemned.jpg)

The plaque next to the door was a *dead* giveaway. 

*I sure hope puns won't destine me for the gallows*

#### Sith Lord Lair

Found next to Swanston Library's second floor is a study area perfect for behooded imperial schemeing, a.k.a. last minute deadline frenzies.

![sith lord study area](250303/sithlordstudy.jpg)

#### #ApeHands

Found on Bowen street, near the corner to La Trobe St, is a statue of an ape's hands throwing up signs. 

![ape hands statue](250303/apehands.jpg)

Unsure of the meaning of this public art installment although I suppose it is always important to remember that gang violence can lead to dismemberment. 

#### Black Box Below

The Black Box Multimedia Space was our next stop, found on level 2 of building 12. Yes, level 2, which is below ground level. *Go figure.*

![Black Box Theatre](250303/blackbox.jpg)

The room was locked, so its suprising interior size had to be inferred on behalf of my recount.

Without insider knowledge, this find would have been a real head scratcher. I suppose RMIT's Campus planning department would do well to undertake DMS1's third stage. Wayfinding is challenging without proper signifiers to help orient students. An explicit sign or room number label would certainly improve student's spatial journies. [;)]

#### Beverages à la far-away

*A machine dispensing beverages?* Must be a vending machine!

We assessed the various vending machines around campus.

The Flying Turtle coffee and bubble tea machine seemed a likely contender, although its relatively compact size and selection's inclusion of somewhat familiar beverages excluded it in the end.

So instead we found this here rather obtuse specimen.

![faraway beverage dispenser](250303/bevsallafaraway.jpg)

#### Tower of eights

Finally, we had to find a golden globe perched upon a tower of eights.

Based on Thomas' tip around the choice of polygonal boundaries of our play area, we consulted the map which defined the confines of our search.

![scavenger hunt map](250303/scavmap.jpg)

What a strange choice to include the little nub in the top right along Victoria St and Russel St. So, off we went to investigate.

Lo and behold:

### Success

With that last item found, we returned to the classroom to boast our triumph.

The curtain of roots is still unclear to me. Perhaps by my third attempt of DMS1, I will have learnt where to look.

## Homework

Leaving class on a high note, I continued on with some tasks outside of class.

### Software get!

To ensure I'm all set to complete this course, I'll have to make sure I have the necessary software installed.

![softwarez](250303/programsinstalled.png)

Luckily I already did.

### User data collect!

To ensure I can actually utilise these programs, I'll also have to make sure I have accounts set up.

First for Unity:

Now, Figma:
