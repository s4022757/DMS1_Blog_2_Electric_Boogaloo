# Session 1

Today in class we covered Design Thinking, which emphasises the importance of planning and implementing a circular work flow when designing.

There was a bunch of useful information about how I should proceed with the next assignment.

We then opened up Illustrator and attempted to get the creative juices flowing with the Black Squares activity.

By only using 4 black squares, we are to respond to each of the 6 concepts presented by arranging the squares in 6 different iterations.

Starting of with "Order"

Then with "Increase"

I was not able to get very far in class, I'll have to continue later.

## Homework

After class I took a look at the homework tasks set for the session.

### LinkedIn Learning

Time to refresh my memory about Illustrator, and any new features this year's edition has introduced. 

Let's head over to the Illustrator 2025 Essential Training course by Tony Harmer on LinkedIn Learning.

I worked through the quizes:

### Finishing Black Squares activity

Now it's time to finish off the activity from class.

This was good practise. It helped ease back into using Illustrator.

To finish the task, I implemented some *design thinking*.

I had to first define, identifying the parameters of the task at hand.
*The only visual element that can be used is a black square, and it must be used 4 times.*

Then to fill the 6 needed responses for each concept, I really had to ideate; brainstorming ideas about how these concepts could be visualised, and narrow this down to what could be feasible with the constraints.

Then the cycle repeated for all 6 concepts, 36 responses.

There were a few tools I used which I was reminded of by the tutorial:
- Navigating the artboard, the hand tool, zooming to selection
- Selecting multiple shapes at once
- Drawing costrained shapes from the center
- Rotating the artboard to selection

That was pretty fun. So far, Illustrator seems fun.
*oh just you wait*

### Assignment 2 prompt

Its time that I chose a direction to go in with the next assignment.

Let's have a look at the list of potential prompts:

- Growth
- Home
- Movement
- Climate
- Community
- Future
- Empty
- Legacy
- Calm
- Memory
- System
- Dream

Out of those the 3 that appeal to me most are:

- Community
- Growth
- System

That said, I chose Community last time I took this course, so to avoid repetition and potential self-plagiarism I should probably choose another.

Growth seems like a good choice, lots of directions that I could go with that. Although, I'd imagine that the icons that are associated with this concept have been done to death.

That's decided then, I'll go towards System. Hopefully I won't regret it.
*I will*

### Brainstorm

Let's hop onto Obsidian.md and create a canvas to whip up a nice mindmap about Systems.

There's a bunch of interesting directions to take this but let's incorporate some design thinking here.

Let's define the prompt here.

I have to make a suit of icons in flat design style. There's a lot of visual complexity possible with this concept. I'll have to consider what is feasible within the constraints.

To clarify, let's also define who our users will be.

WHile thinking about the concept, the video game System Shock came to mind. How about we intend to make our icons in the context of a **videogame UI**. That means our platform should be **Playstation**, or the patrician's choice, PC. 

With that in mind, we might characterise our audience as being **teens and young adults**, and given the genre of the videogame that came to mind, let's elect their interests being **Sci-fi** or cyberpunk as taste in game genre. From this we can assume that they are **tech-savvy**.

That's a good start. We've defined what the design problem is and established which audience to empathise with in the design. Now it's time to explore further and start to ideate some visual representation of the concept we can prototype.

# Session 2

Today in class we looked at Icon design and introduced what flat design is.

We learnt about a good the ways to quickly prototype: thumbnail sketching.

With that in mind we also delved into the vast array of elements that we can use within design, and the effect they have on audiences.
