# Session 1

In today's class we looked at colour theory. There's a lot more to colour then first expected, how we can differentiate and associate them. Along with design elements, our choice of colour also can be used to communicate different things.

Establishing a colour palette is an important step in a design problem.

We then moved on to further exploring flat design and its history.

Another topic on class was the pen tool, my old nemesis.

## Pen tool exercises

To get familiar with the use of Illustrator's pen tool, practice practice pratice.

### The Bézier Game

I opened up the torturous webgame and dived right one in.
*masochism 101*

I will never forgive this game. Oh well, moving on.

Well I'll be damned, I might just have redeemed myself.

Alright, I guess I owe the game an apology. It was just me who was the problem all along.

## Tracing activity

Now that I have all but mastered the pen tool, it's time to replicate an image with my new skills.

We were given some images of Edward Hopper's paintings, and tasked with chosing 2 to trace. One with the pen tool, and one just with shapes.

### Shapes

Ooh Nighthawks, a classic. Hard to resist, although there isn't all the much that could be traced just with shapes. Let's choose another instead.

This quickly becomes quite the undertaking. There is so much detail in a painting like this. Illustrator is equipt with more than enough tools to recreate all of this detail, however tedious. 

Considering then next assignment, flat design style is characterised by simplification of details. Eliminating detail is a tough call, but will be important especially considering the complex nature of the concept I have selected.
